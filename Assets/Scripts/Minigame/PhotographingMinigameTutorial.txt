    "Alright my first step is to properly tag all of the evidence I've found."
    "That is done by walking up to the different pieces of evidence, and pressing 'X'"
    "Once I've done that, I need to take photographs of the scene."
    "This can be done by walking to the proper positions and pressing the 'Q' button to take the picture."
    "I will know that I am in a proper camera position if I see a red block appear over the object."
    "HINT: if you are having trouble, the camera positions will show after 2 minutes of trying."
    "Or you can press 'L' to show the camera positions whenever you want."
