Commands for building a visual novel story / chapter
Every click event is a separate line, events on the same line will be executed at the same time
Each line may have multiple actions delimmited by a space. Because of this, no value, should contain spaces

NOTE: For this to work, if dialogue occurs on a line, the dialogue must be first!
      This is what gives us the ability to not specify a character every time there is dialogue

      The standard format for a command is
          (optional)CharacterName "Dialogue in quotes" EVENTLIST

      The keyword null can be used to set things like backgrounds / music to nothing
          ex-> setBackground(null)

      Optional parameters should work the same way they do in C#
          they must be supplied in the same order
          you only have to supply up to the parameters you want to change (its not all or nothing)

#Make a character speak
  characterName "dialogue"                                                ex: Raelin "Hi, how are you?"

  NOTE: More functionality has been added to the dialogue so that writing large portions of dialogue is easier to do

    {} symbols identify an expectation for user input, different cues do different things

      {c} cue input and clear the dialogue container. Begin new segment
      {a} cue input and append new dialogue to existing (additive)
      {w number} wait for designated time and clear dialogue container.
      {wa number} wait for designated time and append new dialogue to existing. (additive)

      EXAMPLES: "I can write {c}multiple lines of dialogue. {a} on one line now! {wa 0.1}YAAY!"

    [] symbols are used for two things: variables and dialogue events - Keep all Variables, events, and functions separate
      VARIABLES - these are just placed in dialogue in [] brackets
          [mainCharName]
          [curHolyRelic]
      EVENTS - these must have a start and end tag - all examples will be posted here - unlike tags, these can't be nested
          [txtSpd delayBetweenCharacters,charactersPerFrame] Example text.[/txtSpd]
      FUNCTIONS
          Any function can be called with [playMusic(PeacefulForest) ANOTHERMETHOD(params) METHOD3(params)]

      EX:
        "Hello [showScene(true, blur)]everyone"

#not in yet
