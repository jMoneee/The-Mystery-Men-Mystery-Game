		Det. Gruff "No, the ballistics from the shot that killed Det. Hrim do not match this type of gun. However, there was a shot missing."
		"As a professional bodyguard, Det. Petrov would have ensured he arrived at his job with a full set of ammunition, so it is highly likely Det. Petrov shot someone. Just not the victim."
		Dan "I see, then who did he shoot?"
		Det. Gruff "Alright, let's talk about the buyers then."
