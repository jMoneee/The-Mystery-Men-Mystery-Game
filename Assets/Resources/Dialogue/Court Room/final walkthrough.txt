Det. Gruff "Yes I have. In fact, I've got more than that. I can tell you exactly what happened during the crime."
"Four people were present during the crime: the victim, Lukas Hrim, his bodyguard Viy Petrov, and two buyers Terry Horn and James Brown."
"The purpose of the gathering was a drug trade. Based on the amount of drugs in the victim's pockets, it is likely that one buyer was already given his merchandise before the murder occurred."
"When the second buyer, Det. Horn, stepped up to receive his share, something occurred that caused a chain reaction of attacks."
"Det. Horn, standing next to the victim, drew the knife in his posession and thrust it at Det. Hrim, who absorbed the blow with his arm."
"At the same time, Det. Brown, who, based on the fatal shot was likely some distance away, unloaded one bullet into Det. Hrim's chest, killing him."
"Det. Petrov, in attempt to defend his client, shot Det. Brown but only wounded him."
"Upon seeing Det. Hrim dying from Det. Brown's gunshot, all three scattered from the scene."
"Det. Petrov likely ran to the north entrance of the alleyway and dumped his gun in a nearby dumpster,"
"but likely messed up scratched himself on the dumpster, marking it with his blood."
"Det. Brown ran the opposite direction, based on his blood trail and position of his gun."
Finally, Det. Horn likely ran the same direction as Det. Brown to avoid following the hired bodyguard."
"All three left poor Det. Hrim's dead body for us to find."
Dan "I see.. that is certainly a most convincing narrative."
"Thank you for your time, Det. Gruff. Your testimony will prove most useful during this case. No further questions, your honor."
