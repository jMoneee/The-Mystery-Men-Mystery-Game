Det. Gruff "A few things put Mr. Brown here. For one, there's a trail of blood running from the center of the alleyway to the southern entrance."
DNA matching shows this is Mr. Brown's blood. Furthermore, next to that trail of blood was a 1911 R1 pistol,"
"the same model that matches the ballistics on the shot that killed poor Mr. Hrim."
"And Mr. Brown's fingerprints were all over it."
Dan "And no one else had fingerprints on this weapon?"
Det. Gruff "Yup. Only his. There's a little more closure here, too. The amount of blood leaked by Mr. Brown indicates he was heavily wounded."
"And given this is the only other significant loss of blood at the crime scene unrelated to the victim,"
I believe the shot from Mr. Petrov's gun was aimed for Mr. Brown after he pulled the trigger on Mr. Hrim."
Dan "I see.. it seems you're pretty certain on your murderer identity then."
