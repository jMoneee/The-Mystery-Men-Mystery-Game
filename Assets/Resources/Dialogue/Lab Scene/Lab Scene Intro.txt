Det. Gruff "Looks like they are short handed in the crime lab. Thankfully Iâ€™m also a trained crime lab technician and can do all the analysis necessary. Time to get to work." 
"The local Police department also picked up a few suspects that were fleeing the scene."
"Their names are James Brown, Terry Horn and Viy Petrov. They've been fingerprinted and had DNA samples taken. Maybe we can link them to the scene."
"Time to go to the evidence room and look at what we have."
