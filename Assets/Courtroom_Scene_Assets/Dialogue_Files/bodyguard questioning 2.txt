Det. Gruff "The bodyguard's name is Viy Petrov. Just your standard run-of-the-mill hired gun to protect Mr. Hrim should something go wrong."
"Some good that did him..."
Dan "How did you confirm Mr. Petrov was there?"
choice "What ties Viy Petrov to the crime scene?"

	"1911 R1 pistol"

		Det. Gruff "There was a bloodied dumpster at the crime scene that contained a gun. DNA matching confirmed it had Mr. Petrov's fingerprints on it. He was definitely there."
		Dan "So Mr. Petrov was there with a gun. Did he shoot Mr. Hrim?"
		Det. Gruff "No, the ballistics from the shot that killed Mr. Hrim do not match this type of gun. However, there was a shot missing."
		"As a professional bodyguard, Mr. Petrov would have ensured he arrived at his job with a full set of ammunition, so it is highly likely Mr. Petrov shot someone. Just not the victim."
		Dan "I see, then who did he shoot?"
		Det. Gruff "Alright, let's talk about the buyers then."
