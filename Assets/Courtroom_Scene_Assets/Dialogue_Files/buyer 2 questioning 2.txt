		Det. Gruff "Yes. DNA matching on the blood from the knife blade matches the blood of the victim, Lukas Hrim."
		"The victim's arm also has a stab wound matching the knife's blade shape."
		"I believe that Mr. Horn thrust his weapon towards the victim while he was already next to him, likely claiming his drugs,"
		"and the victim raised his arm in self-defense to absorb the blow."
		Dan "I see. But this knife was not the cause of death, correct?"
		Det. Gruff "No, Mr. Horn didn't kill the victim. He simply injured him."
